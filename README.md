# Portfolio Website

This project is a simple portfolio website consisting of an HTML file and a CSS file. The website showcases a developer's profile, previous work, and contact details. The purpose of the website is to provide an online presence for the developer and allow visitors to learn more about their skills and experience.

## HTML File

The HTML file (`index.html`) is structured as follows:

- The document starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and the opening `<html>` tag.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata and external CSS file references.
- The `<body>` section contains the main content of the website.
  - The `<header>` element includes a logo and a navigation bar with links to different sections of the website.
  - The `<main>` element contains the main sections of the website, including the hero section, about me section, previous work section, and contact details section.
  - Each section is wrapped in a `<section>` element and has a unique ID for styling and linking purposes.
- The website concludes with a `<footer>` element for additional information.

## CSS File

The CSS file (`index.css`) contains styles for various elements in the HTML file. Here are some key styles applied:

- General styles are set for the `<body>` element, including background color, text color, font-family, and spacing.
- The `<header>` element is styled to have a specific layout, including a background color, flexbox properties, and logo and navigation styles.
- The hero section (`#hero`) includes a background image, height, and alignment properties.
- The about me section (`#aboutMe`) and previous work section (`#previousWork`) have specific margin and padding properties, and they are displayed as flex containers.
- The contact details section (`#contactMe`) has its own styling, including width and alignment properties.
- Specific styles are applied to different elements within the sections, such as section headers, avatar images, completed works, tooltips, and more.
